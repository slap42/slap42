# Slap42

Slap42 is a game I am building live on Twitch.

## How to play

Right now the only way to play is to compile the game from source yourself. The game uses cmake for the build system and requires C++20.

I'll be uploading .exe files etc to itch.io at some point when there's a few more features implemented.
