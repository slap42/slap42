# Slap42

Slap42 is a game I am building live on Twitch.

I know my code is terrible and I don't care. Feel free to roast me.

If there's a feature you want added or a bug you want fixed, open a github issue or mention it in the twitch chat.

Big shout out to kutobu__, been there since day one, a true believer in the process ü•êüá´üá∑ü•ñüôèüíØ

p0lloc is cool too I guess

## How to play

### Downloading the Game

You can download the game here: https://slap42.itch.io/slap42

I'll release updates on the itch.io page as often as I can remember to. Updates for the Windows version will release much more often than macOS and Linux, because I'm mostly working on a Windows machine. But I'll try to keep them up to date.

Since I am updating the game often, things will break all the time. Sorry.

### Compiling The Game

Alternatively, you can compile the game from source yourself.

The build system is cmake and compiling the game requires C++20.

Windows, macOS, and Linux are supported.

### Hamachi Network

To join the game while I'm live, you can join this Hamachi network:

Please don't write anything racist in the chat and get me banned.

- IP whitelists/blacklists for servers
